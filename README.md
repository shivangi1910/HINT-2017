## REUNION

Want to catch up with a bunch of friends? Need to decide on a date and venue which everyone is happy with? Sick of tedious group conversations?
Then here's an app for you!

Reunion simplifies the task and does the boring stuff for you. Just create a group of attendees, vote for dates and venues feasible, and the task is done. The app lists all available options in decreasing order of the number of people who have voted for them. That's it! Clean and easy to use. 

Happy reunions!
